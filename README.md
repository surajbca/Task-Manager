# Task Manager

## Introduction

A task management application built with React and Material-UI, enabling users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The app persists tasks in local storage, allowing users to retain data even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed
- Search tasks by title
- Set priority levels (High, Medium, Low) for each task
- Responsive design with Material-UI
- Tasks saved to local storage for persistence

## Setup and Launch Process

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd task-manager
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Assumptions

- Users only require a simple task manager with basic priority settings.
- Local storage is sufficient for data persistence.
- Only high, medium, and low priority levels are needed.
